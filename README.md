# Space Missions Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes space missions conducted by organizations like **NASA, SpaceX, ISRO, and Roscosmos** using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis provides insights into mission success rates, costs, scientific yield, and other key metrics. 

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains detailed records of space missions, including:
- **Mission ID**: Unique identifier for each mission
- **Mission Name**: Name of the space mission
- **Launch Date**: Date when the mission was launched
- **Target Type**: Destination type (e.g., Moon, Mars, ISS)
- **Distance from Earth**: Distance covered by the mission
- **Mission Cost**: Cost of the mission
- **Scientific Yield**: Outcomes and scientific achievements
- **Crew Size**: Number of astronauts onboard (if any)
- **Success Rate**: Percentage probability of mission success

##  Analysis Steps
The project follows a structured data analysis workflow:
1. **Data Acquisition** - Loading and understanding the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning missing values, handling inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing key trends and patterns.
4. **Statistical Analysis** - Identifying key mission success factors.
5. **Hypothesis Testing** - Testing assumptions based on mission performance.
6. **Research Findings** - Summarizing insights and conclusions.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis


##  Key Insights & Findings
-  Trends in space mission success rates
-  Cost analysis of different space missions
-  Impact of distance on mission success
-  Relationship between crew size and mission success
